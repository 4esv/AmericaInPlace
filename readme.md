# America In r/Place

---

## This was the first overlay and user script used to better help my fellow patriotic, yet, disorganized Americans place pixels in the [2022 r/Place event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place#2022_experiment).
## My design and overlay were later [replaced](https://place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/#txdyms) when we were forced to re-locate and start again.

Note that not all displayed content reflects my views, part of the excercise was to make allies. Others dealt with the diplomacy aspect I was simply the code monkey.
